      <h2>About My Travel Dreams</h2>
      <p>
        I love discovering new places because they shake me out of daily routines and show me fresh
        ways to see the world. Travel motivates me by combining history, food, and landscapes — each
        trip is a classroom and a reset button. I seek authentic experiences and small adventures that
        change how I think about life.
